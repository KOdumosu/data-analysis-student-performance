# Data Analysis Project – Exploring Student Performance Dataset

## Overview
This project is part of **CSE 310: Applied Programming – Data Analysis Module** at BYU–Idaho.  
The goal of this project is to demonstrate skills in **data cleaning, statistical analysis, and visualization** using Python’s data science libraries.

The program analyzes a public dataset on **student performance** to discover relationships between study habits, parental education, and exam scores. Through this project, I applied the principles of the Kaizen mindset—making consistent, small improvements while learning Pandas and Matplotlib.

## Objectives
- Read and clean a dataset using **Pandas**.  
- Perform basic **statistical analysis** (mean, median, correlations).  
- Generate **visual insights** using **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn**.  
- Present a concise, reproducible data-analysis workflow.  
- Practice version control and professional documentation with GitHub.

## Features
1. Loads data from a CSV file.  
2. Cleans missing or inconsistent data.  
3. Calculates descriptive statistics for key variables.  
4. Creates meaningful visualizations:  
   - Distribution of math, reading, and writing scores.  
   - Correlation heatmap between performance metrics.  
   - Comparison of scores by gender and parental education.  
5. Outputs summary results in the console and displays plots.
